# Metadata Parser
This app allows users to paste in or write pieces of HTML metadata into a textfield and organize the properties of that data in a table.  The table updates in real time so the user can make adjustments to the data and the table will reflect that.  If the user enters information without the correct syntax, a message is displayed to let them know.  The user can click the arrows on the table to organize each column in ascending and descending alphabetical order.
